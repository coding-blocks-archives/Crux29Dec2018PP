Given weights and prices of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total profit in the knapsack. 

In other words, given two integer arrays price[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent price and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum profit subset of price[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 

You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or don't pick it (0-1 property).
